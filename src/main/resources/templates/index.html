    Learning about Cryptocurrency investing
</h2>
<p>
    Cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of
    units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. Many people around the
    world are starting to see the benefits of using a currency that is neither controlled or managed by a central
    governance agency. Although it is a "new" form a currency, it has many benefits that standardized currencies
    don't, including cheap, instant transfers of large sums of money. Cryptocurrency is quickly finding its way into
    main investment strategies and the longer it exists, the more it will be regulated and become trusted. What this
    means is it will continue to grow in a way similar to stocks, where it is gaining value consistently over a
    period of time.
